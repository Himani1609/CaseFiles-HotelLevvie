Please write anything that you want others to know before starting to code:

## Mohith:
- Use bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
- Make sure that the element you are designing is rightly placed under the suitable title that I have written down for you in style.css file. An instance could be Chapter-1 designs, under "CHAPTER - 1 STYLES" title.
- Please avoid inline/internal styling, perhaps we need to have for header & footer which is in navbar.js and footer.js file.
- Fragment 1 to 9 is done. Web designers can start designing them.
- Prototype/Figma design is needed for web developers to design the header & footer. As of yet, I have added the template.
